        <h2>About this Department</h2>
        <p> The 5-year course acquaints students with necessary skills and knowledge to practice architecture while
            understanding the technical aspects and current needs in a creative and imaginative manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Architecture is concerned with the design planning and construction of other structures. There is an
            increase in
            the
            recognition of architecture as one of the top intellectual disciplines that combines art and technology
            while
            being
            closely linked with single largest sector of world economy. Architects are called to design and execute
            building
            projects and also to resolve other issues related to human environment in a different settings. They are
            bound
            to
            work in relation with other architects and engineers who focus on function, layout and aesthetics of
            building
            projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our school focuses on the current trends for budding architects and to look into different methods of
            architectural
            design and how beneficial these traditional and modern means are when it comes to make or create a
            structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Profession and Education of Architecture in India is regulated by the Council of Architecture, a
            national
            statutory body which is followed by the various Universities and Schools of Architecture across country.
        </p>
        <p>
            The course involves some mandatory subject streams with elective subjects which enriches the knowledge of
            the
            students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our school has architectural education in two stages â€“ first stage focuses on skill building and knowledge
            sharing
            and the second stage focuses on the application of the knowledge with the skills and further for exposure
            and
            specialization.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>School of Architecture educates students who contribute to the global community through the design,
            construction
            and
            interpretation of the of built environment, aim to be globally acclaimed for academic excellence in theory
            and
            practice, empowering future design professionals with core values and critical thinking, intellectual
            curiosity,
            ethical behavior and learning to engage architecture in its civic, social and professionals realms for the
            benefit
            of the built and natural environment through innovative open exchange and dialogue between students and
